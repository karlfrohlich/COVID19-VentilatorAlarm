How to Make the Alarm System:
1) Purchase all electronic components listed in the Required_Parts Folder
2) Download .STL files from the 3D_Printed_Parts Folder
3) 3D Print the files (we recommend using PLA plastic at >50% infill)
4) Assemble the plastic and electric parts to specification as seen in the Pictures Folder
5) Download the code from the Arduino_Code Folder and upload it to the Arduino Board
